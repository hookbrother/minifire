# General

I plan to wrote an os based on linux-0.11.
In fact, I can only copy the linux-0.11 first.

# Development environment
OS: archlinux 64
Editor: GNU Emacs 24.3.1
Compilerï¼šas as86 gcc
Linker: ld ld86
Debugger: bochs

## First, I must accomplish the boot part.
* bootsect.s
* setup.s
* head.s
